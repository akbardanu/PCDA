# Welcome to my website!

Hello, my name is Akbar Danu Yudhistira 210411100005, and welcome to my personal site! Here I use it as documentation for an assignment or project from class A in the digital image processing course.

I enjoyed studying the Digital image processing course and sharing what I learned with readers. Every article on this blog is created with the hope of providing benefits and inspiration to anyone who reads it.
